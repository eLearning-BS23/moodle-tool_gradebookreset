# Reset Course Completion

Moodle Reset Course Completion is an admin tool module plugin, which resets course userâ€™s grades from the gradebook. Multiple users can be selected at once to reset their grades. It resets manually added, hidden, overridden, excluded and locked grades. Even the grades that are associated with activity also gets deleted.

We are constantly improving the plugin, so stay tuned for upcoming versions.
